Enhanced cd
===========

Combine the functinionality of builtin commands cd, pushd, and popd, adding
some additional features.

Change the current directory to DIR, searching for hidden files named
`.enterrc' and `.exitrc'. Maintain a menu-driven history list to assist in
changing to prior directories.

The .enterrc/.exitrc idea is borrowed from Jerry Peek's Power Tools article
14.14. It expands on this idea by searching all subdirectories of the
destination directory having an uncommon base.

It is implemented as a shell function to enable .exitrc/.enterrc pairs to
perform environment-setting tasks, such as setting a prompt or umask or
variables. As a function, it resides in shell memory and so executes with no
visible delay. Functions do not fork a subprocess so all executed commands are
able to affect the current shell.
